# CoCoReco-ECCV2024
Code base for our paper "Connectivity-Inspired Network for Context-Aware Recognition" (ECCV 2024, Human-inspired Computer Vision workshop)

## Dataset
In this work, we used Imagenette, a smaller version of the popular Imagenet dataset, composed by the images corresponding to the 10 more easily classified classes.
You can find additional information on this dataset at [this page](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette?tab=readme-ov-file#imagenette-1). To download the "160 px" version, as we did, just download this [*.tgz*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fast-ai-imageclas/imagenette2-160.tgz) file. If you are a Linux user, you can easily get that file from the command line interface with

```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/fast-ai-imageclas/imagenette2-160.tgz
```
